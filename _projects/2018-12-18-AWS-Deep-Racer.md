## Introduction

AWS DeepRacer is a 1/18th scale race car which gives you an interesting, fun way to get started with reinforcement learning (RL). RL is an advanced machine learning (ML) technique which takes a very different approach to training models than other machine learning methods. Its super power is that it learns very complex behaviors without requiring any labeled training data, and can make short term decisions while optimizing for a longer term goal.

This study group will focus on study and understanding on system design, SW architecture and  how to build and play with one of those cars.

There is also a global competition, depending on progress one of the cools targets is to compete in the AWS global competition as a **SEOUL AI TEAM** ( or any other fancy name ) and show the world what Korea can do in terms of ML/AI and Robotics.
