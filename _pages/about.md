We encourage small interest groups that members can actively participate and make proof-of-concept of their projects. 

Do you want to brush up your skill? 
Join the interest goups!

Do you want to find people having same interest? 
Propose one!

We host practical events like series of hackathons with the interest groups. 
Join our upcoming events!
