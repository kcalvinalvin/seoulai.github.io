## Overview

Seoul AI is hosting our 4th AI hackathon on **Saturday, 15th of December**. This hackathon is based on a new toolkit from SeoulAI for developing AI algorithms: Seoul AI Gym. This gym simulates various environments and enables the use of any teaching techniques on an agent. The goal of every hackathon participant is to develop an agent that can trade cryptocurrency. Each participant will train an agent to compete to become the most successful trader. Participants are free to chose any machine learning algorithm of their choice. SeoulAI will provide the real-time dataset.

## Competition

All agents will receive virtual **100,000,000KRW** at 10:00. The agent with the highest revenue by 18:50 will be the winner of the competition.

We encourage you to participate in the competition from the start of the competition, but you can join at any time on December 15th.
